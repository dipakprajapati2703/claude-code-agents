## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Usage

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

Coordinate multiple agents for complex projects:

```bash
# Create project with automatic agent selection
claude-code /create "Full-stack e-commerce with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL"

# This automatically assigns:
# - frontend-developer for React UI
# - backend-developer for Node.js API  
# - database-specialist for PostgreSQL
# - devops-engineer for deployment
```

### Project Registry Management

Track multiple projects:

```bash

# Switch active project  
claude-code projects switch my-project

# View project status
claude-code projects status
```

### Custom Agent Development

Create specialized agents for your domain:

```bash
# Generate new agent
claude-code /generate-agent "shopify-theme-developer"

# Edit agent configuration
vim ~/.claude/agents/shopify-theme-developer.md

# Use new agent
claude-code agent shopify-theme-developer "Create responsive product page"
